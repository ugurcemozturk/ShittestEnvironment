ShittestEv is an environment simulation at its shittest. 


  - Microservices that communicate each other(.Net, Spring, Rails, etc.)
  - Clustered IndexDBs
  - Missconfigured load-balancers(nginx and a custom one with express.js for now.)
  - Circuit brackers for services

  - Service discovery
      - For orchestration of the services maybe we can use Netflix OSS or custom ones. 
  - Message brokers and queues
  - Master-Slave type DBs that allows dynamic role replacement.
  - Able to get scaled horizontally
  - CI/CI
  - ELK Stack
  - Contribute with yours!!
